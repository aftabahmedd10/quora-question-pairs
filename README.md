## Quora Duplicate Question Pair Detection

### Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to identify duplicate question pairs on Quora. By detecting duplicate questions, the system improves content management, enhances user experience, and reduces redundancy on the platform.

### Description
This project uses a dataset of question pairs from Quora to train a classification model that predicts whether two questions are duplicates. The system leverages various features extracted from the text of the questions, such as semantic similarity, keywords, and context, to make accurate predictions.

### Key Features
#### Dataset Attributes:
- **question1**: The first question in the pair.
- **question2**: The second question in the pair.
- **is_duplicate**: Binary label indicating whether the questions are duplicates (1) or not (0).

#### Feature Engineering:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: To convert text into numerical form, capturing the importance of words.
- **Word Embeddings**: Using pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent semantic meaning of questions.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between two questions based on their vector representations.
  
#### Model:
- **Classification Algorithm**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Deep Learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) to predict whether the question pair is a duplicate or not.
  
### Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
  - NLTK / SpaCy: For text preprocessing and natural language processing tasks.
  - TensorFlow / Keras: For deep learning models (if applicable).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration, model building, and visualization.

### Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove irrelevant features, and preprocess text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features like TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and word embeddings to represent the textual data.
3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) or deep learning model (e.g., LSTM or BERT) on the labeled question pairs.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Expected Outcomes
- **Duplicate Detection**: Accurately identify duplicate question pairs, helping improve content management and reduce redundancy.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Provide users with a cleaner and more relevant browsing experience on the Quora platform.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automate the process of identifying duplicate questions to reduce manual intervention.

### Acknowledgements
This project uses publicly available question pair data from Quora, and the model leverages popular NLP and machine learning techniques to achieve accurate results.
